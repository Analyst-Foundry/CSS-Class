    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <pre>
        I saw you laughin' in one of his pictures
        Bet you'll be the one with his ring on your finger
        There's red and green everywhere, but I'm so blue
        Cindy Lou Who
        Maybe he met you somewhere in the desert
        While he was soul-searchin', he found someone better
        Guess you make him happy like I couldn't do
        Cindy Lou Who
    </pre> 

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <pre>
        (Ooh) With your hair so long, lips so red
        (Ooh) Maybe we met once, I forget
        (Ooh) Scrollin' five yеars back, I'm obsessed
        Breakin' my hеart, 'tis the season, I guess 
    </pre>

    <h3 class="class1">[Instrumental Break]</h3>
    <br>

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <pre>
        (Ooh) With your hair so long, lips so red
        (Ooh) If you're wakin' up now in his old bed
        (Ooh) At his family's house, know that you're just
        Breakin' my heart, 'tis the season, I guess
    </pre>

    <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
    <pre>
        The snow's gonna fall and the tree's gonna glisten
        And I'm gonna puke at the thought of you kissin'
        The boy who I love is now in love with you
        Cindy Lou Who
    </pre>

    <h2>[Outro]</h2>
    <pre>
        I told all my friends, they said it can't be true
        Cindy Lou Who
